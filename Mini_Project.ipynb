Asked whether the candidates have the right personality and temperament to be president, 61% said Clinton does, while 31% said Trump does. Just 33% said Trump understands international matters, while 72% said Clinton does.\\nTrustworthiness is a problem for both candidates: Only 38% view Clinton as honest and trustworthy, and just 34% say Trump is honest and trustworthy.\\nThe survey shows the damage of Trump's criticism of the Khan family -- the parents of a US soldier killed in combat who blasted Trump at the Democratic National Convention.\\nOf those surveyed, 73% -- including 59% of Republicans -- said they disapprove of Trump's handling of the situation.\\nClinton leads Trump among women, 58% to 35%, and has a 19-point edge among college-educated white women -- a key group both parties target.\\nThe poll found that Clinton is viewed favorably by 48% of registered voters and unfavorably by 50%; Trump is viewed favorably by just 34% and unfavorably by 63%.\\nTheir running mates are popular but much less-known.

       " \"CNN Article2\\n\\n\\n\\n(CNN)Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are neck-and-neck in a new national tracking poll out Tuesday morning.\\n\\nThe latest ABC News/The Washington Post offering showed Trump barely edging Clinton among likely voters, 46%-45%, well within the poll's 3 percentage point margin of error. Support for Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson, meanwhile has fallen to a new low, according to the poll, plunging to just 3% nationwide. Green Party candidate Jill Stein is at 2%.\\nAlthough Trump's single-point advantage over Clinton is statistically negligible, it is his first lead in an ABC/Post poll since May -- perhaps giving hope to the Republican presidential nominee's supporters, who believe their candidate's prospects were bolstered last week with the revelation that the FBI is reviewing new emails found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, the former congressman and estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.\\nwho's winning?\\ncnn/orc\\tcnn poll of polls\\nHillary Clinton headshot photo\\n49%clinton\\nDonald Trump headshot photo\\n44%trump\\nGary Johnson headshot photo\\n3%johnson\\nJill Stein headshot photo\\n2%stein\\nCNN/ORC poll, October 20-23, 2016, sampling error: +/- 3.5 percentage points, sample: 779 likely voters\\nget more data insights\\nStill, it may be too early to gauge the electoral impact of that development, which broke on Friday. Clinton still leads Trump in the CNN Poll of Polls, an average of the five most recent national phone polls, including Tuesday's ABC/WaPo tracking survey, 46%-42%.\\nThe latest ABC/Post poll showed a lack of enthusiasm among Clinton supporters. Only 45% of the Democratic nominee's backers say they are very enthusiastic about supporting her, down 7 percentage points since the start of the tracking poll and eight points lower than the share of Trump supporters who say they are very enthusiastic about supporting their candidate.\\nThe latest ABC/Post tracking poll was conducted October 27-30 using phone interviews with 1,128 likely voters. It has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.\",\n",
       " 'CNN Article3\\n\\n\\nClinton, Trump make final pitches\\n\\n\\n\\nWashington (CNN)President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama sought to lift Hillary Clinton to victory while Donald Trump warned she was the \"face of failure\" and predicted he would blow her away in Tuesday\\'s election.\\n\\nOn a dramatic final day of the ugliest campaign in modern history, the candidates and their surrogates held nearly two dozen rallies, chased one another through swing states and made desperate last pleas to voters.\\n2016 exit polls\\nClinton won the tiny town of Dixville Notch, New Hampshire, as eight residents cast midnight ballots in an election day tradition. Four voted for Clinton, two backed Trump while one person supported Libertarian Gary Johnson and one person wrote in 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClinton and Trump both go into Election Day with paths to the White House. But Clinton has many more options to secure the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.\\nPerhaps reflecting optimism, Clinton stressed national unity in her closing appearances Monday, while Trump returned to his claims that the political system and the media were rigged against him.\\n7 things to watch for on election night\\nThe former secretary of state capped her campaign with a remarkable passing-of-the-baton rally with President Obama before a crowd of about 20,000 against the symbolic backdrop of Independence Hall in Philadelphia.\\n\"I regret deeply how angry the tone of the campaign became,\" Clinton said, prompting one woman in the crowd to shout out, \"Not your fault!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Clinton went on to slam the \"many troubling things\" Trump had said about women, Muslims, Latinos and African-Americans. She said Trump\\'s \"most horrifying\" comment was his warning that he may not accept the election result.\\n\"Let\\'s show tomorrow there will be no question about the outcome of this election!\" Clinton said.\\nObama introduced Clinton in a speech that was both a firm endorsement and a poignant farewell to politics.\\n\"We now have the chance to elect a 45th president who will build on our progress who will finish the job ... who is smart, who is steady and who is tested,\" Obama said. \"She will work, she will deliver. She won\\'t just tweet.\"\\n\\n\\nThe President said he was counting on Americans not to elect Trump.\\n\"America, I am betting on you one more time,\" Obama said, predicting the nation would \"reject fear\" and choose hope.\\nMichelle Obama, who has used her popularity to become perhaps Clinton\\'s most powerful surrogate, called on Democrats to turn out in huge numbers to prevent Trump becoming president.\\n\"This election is on us. It is in our hands,\" she said. \"If we get out and vote tomorrow, Hillary Clinton will win.\"\\n\\'Face of failure\\'\\nTrump, meanwhile, presented himself as the face of change for Americans, whom he said had been let down by a corrupt political system.\\n\"Hillary is the face of failure. She\\'s the face of failure,\" Trump said, blasting Clinton\\'s political record and service as secretary of state.\\nThe Republican nominee claimed -- in defiance of polls showing a mid-single digit Clinton lead -- that he was tied with his rival in Pennsylvania, a state that forms a crucial part of Clinton\\'s Democratic firewall.\\n\"They say we\\'re tied in Pennsylvania. I don\\'t think so. I think we\\'re going to blow them out tomorrow. Blow them out,\" Trump said at a rally in Scranton, one of the most hotly contested parts of the state.\\nThe latest CNN Poll of Polls gives Clinton a four-point lead over Trump, 46% to 42%. In most of the swing states that will decide, the race is tight. But if Clinton can hang on to most states that have voted Democratic in recent elections and add at most a couple of swing states, she will likely win the election.\\nBut Democrats are worried about Trump\\'s strength in the Midwest -- particularly in Michigan, which has not voted Republican since 1988. Trump has been making a strong push there amid narrowing polls.\\nTrump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway predicted that Trump will win Michigan, telling ABC\\'s \"Good Morning America\" that the campaign feels \"really good\" about the latest polling in upper Midwest states.\\nIn final push, Trump\\'s aggressive campaign swing creeps past midnight\\nBut Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said late visits to Michigan by both Clinton and Obama on Monday were more a function of the calendar and the lack of early voting there than a sign of genuine anxiety.\\n\"Our strategy these last few days is to focus on the states where voting overwhelmingly happens on Election Day,\" Mook said on CNN\\'s \"New Day.\" \"Previously, as you\\'ve seen, we\\'ve been focused on states like Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, where the majority of the voting happens early.\"\\nHe continued: \"So, this is really a reflection of the voting calendar. Donald Trump has been kind of running to each and every state it seems. So they have their strategy. But we have ours.\"\\nTrump scraps for every electoral vote\\nTrump has little margin for error.\\n\\n\\nHe will need to win Ohio, North Carolina and Florida, where he is locked in close races with Clinton, just to give him a chance to make the near-perfect run through the remaining swing states that he needs to capture the presidency.\\nDemocrats are particularly encouraged by indications of a surge of Hispanic voters in early voting in Florida and Nevada. But there also are warning signs for Clinton, with African-Americans not as large a proportion of the early-voting electorate as they were for Obama in 2008 and 2012.\\nCNN\\'s most recent electoral map shows Clinton is projected to win 268 electoral votes from states that are solidly blue or leaning in her direction. Trump has 204 votes from states that are solidly in his column or leaning that way. A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win the White House.\\nGOP strategist: Clinton will win -- but Congress won\\'t work with her\\nIn the latest CNN Poll of Polls data in the swing states, Clinton leads 45% to 43% in North Carolina, the rivals are tied at 45% in Florida and Clinton leads by five points in Pennsylvania, a state Trump hopes to turn red.\\nIn New Hampshire, where the race moved toward Trump in the last week, Clinton is still up up 44% to 41%. New Hampshire only has four electoral votes, but Trump\\'s path to 270 is so difficult that votes from smaller states could still be crucial for him.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe presidential election is not the only close race that will wrap up on Tuesday. Democrats are battling to grab back the Senate from Republicans. The GOP, meanwhile, is expected to hold onto the House of Representatives, but likely with a reduced majority.\\nSpeaker Paul Ryan said Monday that he would run again for the top job, despite reports in recent days that he may opt out or that more radical members of his restive caucus could try to oust him, after deeming him insufficiently supportive of Trump.\\n\"I am going to stay -- you know why? Because I moved our majority to put out a very specific and coherent agenda. We have it, we\\'re running on it,\" Ryan said on the Charlie Sykes radio show.\\nAsked who would win the presidential race, Ryan said he genuinely did not know, because \"it is such a weird election, such a volatile election.\"',\n",

Fuming crowds at Donald Trump\\'s rallies harness their hatred of Hillary Clinton with the chant, \"Lock her up.\" Clinton, meanwhile, depicts a Trump victory as an apocalyptic event.\\nView latest election results\\nNo wonder the country is at the end of its rope.\\n\"At this point we are all boiled frogs. We are wondering why our skin is falling off,\" said Tommy Vietor, who worked for Barack Obama\\'s 2008 presidential campaign and in the White House and now co-hosts the \"Keeping it 1600\" podcast. \"I think when this election ends and people stop for a minute and people actually reflect, they will realize how insane and horrible and unprecedented it really was.\"\\nRoad to 270: CNN\\'s latest electoral college map\\nElection obsession syndrome is taking hold of the country. Its main symptoms are soaring ratings for cable news shows and frequent refreshing of polling and election forecasting websites. With Clinton\\'s lead over Trump in battleground states shrinking in the final stretch, the next two days promise to be even more nerve-wracking as both sides angle for victory.\\nThe cover of next week\\'s New Yorker sums up the brittle national mood -- especially among fretful liberals -- picturing a man on a train reading a newspaper with the headlines \"Oh Sweet Jesus, Please God No,\" and \"Anything But That.\"\\nEven \"Saturday Night Live\" has had enough. During the opening sketch Saturday, Alec Baldwin broke out of his Trump impression and turned to Kate McKinnon, who plays Clinton, and said: \"I\\'m sorry, Kate. I just hate yelling this stuff at you like this.\"\\n\"Yes, I know, right?\" she answered. \"This whole election has been so mean.\"\\n\"I just feel gross all the time. Don\\'t you guys feel gross all the time about this?\" Baldwin asked the audience.\\nThe pair then ran outside the studio. Baldwin hugged an African-American man and McKinnon embraced a man with a \"Make America Great Again\" hat who gave her a piggy-back ride while she ate cotton candy. It was a cathartic moment meant to celebrate the diversity of American life.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnxiety among Democrats\\nAmong Democrats, there is a palpable sense of intense anxiety about Clinton\\'s prospects. Her campaign was rocked when FBI Director James Comey revived her email controversy, triggering growing concern that Trump could win.\\n\"Every Democrat I know right now is checking the validity of their passports,\" CNN commentator Van Jones said Friday on \"Erin Burnett OutFront.\"\\nFor his part, Trump has shown remarkable discipline over the past week, further unnerving Democrats who are used to baiting him into a meltdown.\\nConservative talk radio icon Rush Limbaugh crowed this week that \"we have panic starting to set in in the Democrat Party and in the Drive-By Media.\"\\nOn Friday, CNN modified its projected electoral map, for the first time putting Clinton\\'s current total of electoral votes below the magic number of 270.\\nThe Twitter account of David Plouffe, the former Obama election guru, has become a source of free therapy for nervous Democrats.\\nEarly voting update: Battlegrounds tight with 30 million ballots cast\\n\"Clinton path to 300+ rock solid. Structure of race not affected by Comey\\'s reckless irresponsibility.

She\\'s focused,\" billionaire and Clinton supporter Mark Cuban told reporters Friday. \"I\\'ve been around situations when people are anxious. You see people choke. Look, she\\'s confident. She\\'s good.\"\\nDespite the tightening race, Clinton\\'s campaign remains convinced that her advantage on the electoral map will hold and she will prevail on Tuesday. But that\\'s unlikely to calm everybody down.\\n\"Both Democrats and Republicans are really worked up,\" said Sam Wang, who runs the Princeton Election Consortium and questions whether the emotions whipped up by the race are justified by the facts of the election.\\n\\'Separate the drama from the data\\'\\n\"In my own mind, I try to separate the drama from the data. Early this season, I noticed that no matter what happened, opinion didn\\'t move that much,\" Wang said in an e-chat on CNN.com this week. \"The race has shown less variation than ever in the history of presidential polling. It made me realize that the race probably wasn\\'t going anywhere. But when was the last time a presidential race was this emotional?\"\\n\\n\\nVietor agrees that the level of emotional involvement is out of whack with what has been an unusually stable race that has not been permanently shaken by even stunning events like Clinton\\'s fainting spell in September or the release of an \"Access Hollywood\" tape in which Trump is heard making sexually aggressive remarks.\\n\"It does feel like every day something is said or done that in another election would be a blockbuster or game changing story,\" Vietor said. But in this race, \"it feels like the half life of any major story is five days.\"\\nThe election was always going to be an emotional roller coaster, given the candidates.\\nIn Clinton and Trump, their parties nominated the two candidates most guaranteed to cause the maximum amount of alienation on the other side.\\nThe faithful who will never leave her\\nTrump is so far outside the normal parameters of what is accepted behavior for a potential president, firing off conspiracy theories and outright falsehoods in his stump speeches, it is not surprising he rouses fierce emotions. The Republican nominee has deliberately stoked anger, grievances and grass roots fury, using demagogic techniques to power his anti-establishment campaign.\\nHis presidency would in many ways be a leap into the unknown for America and the world -- so heightened concern is inevitable.\\nBut Trump is not the only candidate who evokes strong feelings.\\nPolarizing personalities\\nFor more than a quarter of a century, Clinton has been one of the most polarizing personalities in American politics. While Trump has gone further than most of her other critics in openly branding her a crook, the intensity of feeling towards her among conservatives is visceral.\\nThe candidates are doing nothing to calm things down -- seeing raging emotions as a tool to get their base voters to the polls.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I think this will be the last election if I don\\'t win. I think this will be the last election that the Republicans have a chance of winning,\" Trump told David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network in September, warning Democrats would naturalize millions of illegal immigrants to swamp the voting rolls.\\nClinton warns Trump could incite Armageddon.\\n\"Think about what it would mean to entrust the nuclear codes to someone. with a very thin skin, who lashes out at anyone who challenges him,\" she said in Pittsburgh on Friday. \"Imagine how easily it could be that Donald Trump would feel insulted and start a real war -- not just a Twitter war -- at three in the morning.\"\\nObama went even further this week warning during a campaign trip, \"the fate of the world is teetering and you, North Carolina, are going to have to make sure that we push it in the right direction.\"\\nGiven the intensity of the feelings, it\\'s unlikely that the fury stoked by this election will quickly dissipate after Tuesday. It will likely be a powerful force in shaping the presidency of whoever wins.\\nBut one longtime Washington sage, Charlie Cook, has a message for a divided nation in his latest National Journal column: Take a breath.\\n\"My advice is for folks to ease off the caffeine, maybe watch less television news, take in a movie, play a round of golf, or do whatever lowers their blood pressure and preserves their sanity,\" Cook wrote. \"This country has survived a lot, and it will still stand tall whatever happens on Tuesday.\"',\n",
       " 'CNN Article5\\n\\n\\n7 things to watch for on election night\\n\\n\\nWashington (CNN)Donald Trump is attempting to crack Hillary Clinton\\'s blue wall. And Clinton is hoping for a surge in Latino turnout fueled by opposition to Trump.\\n\\nThe two candidates are making a last-minute dash across swing states like Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina as the 2016 presidential race enters its final hours. They\\'ve also gone north to Michigan and New Hampshire to states Democrats have won in recent cycles but could flip this year.\\nExit polls: Live updates\\nHere are the key states and signs to study as the night unfolds:\\nTrump\\'s must-wins\\nMost plausible paths to victory for Trump start with holding onto two battlegrounds that Mitt Romney won four years ago -- North Carolina and Arizona -- and flipping three states President Barack Obama carried: Florida, Ohio and Iowa.\\nA loss in any of the states would severely complicate Trump\\'s already precarious path to 270 electoral votes. Though if Trump clawed back Pennsylvania or Michigan from the Democrats, who have won both electoral-rich states six times in a row, North Carolina would be more expendable. A win in a state like Pennsylvania or Michigan would allow Trump to offset a loss in North Carolina and still have a shot at reaching 270.\\nIf that doesn\\'t happen, holding North Carolina and Arizona, while reclaiming Florida, Ohio and Iowa from the Democrats -- plus Maine\\'s 2nd District -- would only get him to 260.\\nTrump would need to tack on 10 more electoral votes somehow. New Hampshire\\'s four and Nevada\\'s six would get him there. Colorado, with nine electoral votes, Michigan with 15 and Pennsylvania with 20 are also possibilities.\\nIn his last 48 hours before Election Day, Trump has been pretty much everywhere, including Colorado, Michigan -- even Minnesota -- searching for the extra votes he needs.\\nClinton\\'s must-wins\\nThe key question for Clinton is whether her \"blue wall\" of Democratic-leaning states on the Great Lakes -- Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin -- will hold.\\nTrump has targeted all three, but Clinton has consistently led polls in all three states. However, most voters in Michigan and Pennsylvania cast their ballots on Election Day -- which means her campaign hasn\\'t built the early voting advantage already in place elsewhere.\\nIf Clinton can do that and pick up just one of North Carolina, Florida or Ohio, she\\'s all but guaranteed to win.\\nIf she can\\'t win one of those three states, she\\'ll need to hold Virginia, vote-by-mail Colorado, New Hampshire and Nevada -- where Democrats have already built a hefty early voting edge.\\nDoes Latino turnout surge?\\n\\n\\nIf Clinton wins, her coalition will consist of women, college-educated voters and a swell of new Latino voters.\\nIn early voting in states like Nevada, and Florida, there\\'s already evidence of burgeoning Latino turnout. This is best witnessed by the over 57,000 people who voted in Nevada Friday, with pictures of long lines and extended hours at a Latino grocery store in Clark County.\\nMany first-time voters, polls show, are turning out to oppose Trump. And Democrats are bullish that Latinos have been under-polled through the entire 2016 election cycle.\\nFor Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, this is a ghost of elections past. After the 2012 race, the RNC warned that the party needed to do more to court Latino voters. A nominee who roundly rejected that advice could be the reason the party loses a third consecutive presidential race.\\nJust as Trump\\'s attacks on Mexican immigrants have alienated Latino voters, his attacks on women and allegations of sexual assault have helped Clinton to a large lead among female voters. Clinton\\'s campaign has highlighted Trump\\'s most derogatory remarks in TV ads aimed at moderate, suburban women -- a constituency that has helped Republican nominees in years past. If she succeeds, it would limit Trump\\'s strengths to rural areas.\\nDoes Trump have a \"silent majority\"?\\nTrump\\'s biggest strength is his overwhelming support from disaffected white voters -- particularly men, and especially those without college degrees.\\nHis campaign has long argued that those voters -- many of them independent or Democrats who buy into Trump\\'s protectionist stance on trade -- will carry him on Election Day.\\nFor this to happen, Trump will also need core Democratic voters to stay at home, as well.\\nAlready, Trump appears poised to win Iowa, and has polled ahead of Clinton in Ohio. He\\'s hoping to win enough blue-collar Democrats in Pennsylvania or Michigan to win at least one of those states.\\nMichigan, in particular, emerged as a tempting target in the campaign\\'s closing days -- a state hard-hit by the trade deals Trump bemoans. Clinton\\'s campaign raced to play defense, dispatching the former secretary of state there, as well as President Barack Obama, for last-minute rallies.\\nDo African-American voters show up?\\nAmong Democrats\\' biggest concerns has been whether African-American voters -- a reliably left-leaning constituency -- will turn out in numbers anywhere close to their support for Obama in 2008 and 2012.\\nIf the answer is no, it could hobble Clinton in key states -- particularly Florida and North Carolina.\\nObama is helping carry Clinton\\'s load with black voters. In a call to Tom Joyner\\'s radio show, he argued that participating in this election is just as much about him as it is about Clinton.\\n\"And I know that there are a lot of people in barbershops and beauty salons, you know, in the neighborhoods who are saying to themselves \\'We love Barack, we love -- we especially love Michelle -- and so, you know, it was exciting and now we\\'re not excited as much,\\'\" he said. \"You know what? I need everybody to understand that everything we\\'ve done is dependent on me being able to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things I believe in.\"\\nThe post-Trump GOP starts now\\nSince Trump clinched the GOP nomination in May, Republican Senate and House candidates have been forced to answer for everything he has said -- from his attacks on a Gold Star family and an Indiana-born judge\\'s heritage to his rejection of conservative orthodoxy.\\nAs soon as the election ends, Capitol Hill Republicans -- especially if they retain control of both the House and Senate -- will regain power.\\nThe party will have to decide just what to do with Trump\\'s rejection of free trade, his calls for a decreased US role overseas and his criticism of GOP congressional leaders -- whether he wins or loses.\\nBut adopting some of Trump\\'s policy planks while rejecting his political style might not help much after an election driven by the candidates\\' personalities.\\nHow the loser handles losing\\nFor a nation divided by a long, bitter contest, this could be the most important question of all: Will the loser concede -- and how will he or she do it?\\nTrump and Clinton are both historically unpopular presidential nominees. Half the country thinks Clinton is a crook, and the other half thinks Trump is a racist and misogynist.\\nAnd Trump, in particular, has cast the election as rigged -- calling into question whether ballots that are mailed in will be counted, playing up inaccurate reports of voter irregularities and claiming that voter fraud is pervasive.\\nThe loser will play a crucial role in legitimizing the victor -- or delegitimizing the winner from the outset.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Georgia has voted heavily Republican in every presidential election since 1992, when they last voted for a Democrat, former President Bill Clinton.\\nIt's just the latest state thought to be safely in Republican hands that has shown the possibility of flipping for Clinton. A poll earlier this week also showed her leading in Arizona, a traditionally red state. Changing demographics in the country and Trump's missteps have been credited with putting more states in play for Democrats.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Clinton could lose both Georgia and Arizona and still hold on to a commanding advantage in the electoral college, thanks in part to her leads in states like Virginia.\\nThe CNU poll out Friday put Clinton up by 12 points, 45% to 33%. That's in keeping with polling in the state that has consistently shown Clinton well ahead in the swing state.\\nBoth polls reveal a gender gap that has been perceived nationwide, with Clinton winning among women by a sizable margin and Trump leading among men.\\nLibertarian candidate Gary Johnson was at 9% in Georgia and 8% in Virginia.\\nBoth polls had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points, though Georgia's likely voter sample error margin was 4.3 points, and both surveys were conducted this week mostly before the final presidential debate.

An overnight panic in global markets evaporated as Wall Street gave an emphatic welcome to President-elect Donald Trump.\\nThe Dow soared 257 points and brushed up against lifetime highs on Wednesday, in defiance of those who predicted Trump\\'s election would bring about a plunge in the stock market. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rose 1.1% apiece.\\nThe impressive market performance represents a dramatic reversal from the knee-jerk panic in global markets overnight as the results were coming in. Dow futures plummeted nearly 900 points at one point as investors expressed fear that no one would emerge victorious and concern about the inherent uncertainties brought on by a Trump White House.\\nBut a sense of relative calm returned to the markets by morning. The rally gathered momentum midday after Hillary Clinton, Wall Street\\'s favored candidate, officially conceded.\\nMarket strategists said the upbeat mood in the markets is due in part to Trump\\'s victory speech, which raised hopes that he will focus on policies that can help the economy and not follow through on some of his extreme campaign positions.\\nContent by Samruk-Kazyna\\nWhat are the objectives of Kazakhstan\\'s privatisation drive?\\nKazakhstan\\'s brave new economic world.\\n\"The selloff last night was an hysterical reaction,\" said David Bianco, chief U.S. equity strategist at Deutsche Bank. \"There are a lot of potentially damaging policies that could be introduced, but we think sober minds will prevail.\"\\nPeter Kenny, an independent market strategist, admitted that the market has \"greeted Trump with a far more positive footing than I expected. He\\'s receiving a very warm welcome.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nStill, it\\'s clear that global markets are on edge. Asian stocks fell sharply, led by a 5% plunge for the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo amid concerns about how Japan\\'s trade-centric economy would weather Trump\\'s anti-trade rhetoric. European markets also slumped initially, before recovering and are mostly in the green now.\\nThe Mexican peso plummeted over 11% at one point to a new all-time low against the U.S. dollar. Top Mexican finance officials said they would take steps to shore up the peso, but failed to lay out concrete details.\\nTrump\\'s tough talk on trade with Mexico is seen as a direct threat to the Mexican economy, which depends heavily on trade with the U.S.\\nRelated: Mexican peso plunges to all-time low\\nGold, which tends to do well when investors are scared, surged 3% overnight. However, the precious metal eased back ended the day flat, confounding those who predicted a dramatic surge if Trump won.\\n\"This is a bit like Brexit,\" said Ed Yardeni, president of investment advisory Yardeni Research. \"The polls indicated a victory for the status quo. Instead, the vote came out with a radical alternative scenario.\"\\nIndeed, just a day before the election, the Dow had roared nearly 400 points after the FBI again cleared Clinton in the email investigation. It was the latest evidence that investors were anticipating a victory from Clinton, who represented more stability than Trump.\\n\"People were not positioned for this and that\\'s going to have some aftershocks,\" said Michael Block, chief market strategist at Rhino Trading.\\nThat explains the dramatic moves for stocks that were seen as big winners or losers in a Clinton White House. For instance, Wall Street raced on Wednesday to buy up shares of biotech and prison companies -- two industries Clinton had singled out for attack. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB)soared 9% and drug makers like Shire (SHPG) spiked 9%.\\nRelated: What President Trump means for your pocketbook\\nBig banks are also rising amid an uptick in interest rates and on hopes that Trump will follow through with promises to dial back the Dodd-Frank regulatory reform. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) soared nearly 5% and hit a new lifetime high, while Morgan Stanley (MS) surged 7%. Of course, Trump has also called to break up the big banks by bringing back the Glass-Steagall Act.\\nDefense stocks like Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) are flying high as well, a sign that Wall Street is betting Trump and the GOP-led Congress will ramp up military spending.\\nLikewise, Trump has promised to spend heavily on rebuilding America\\'s infrastructure. That\\'s great news for construction and materials companies like Caterpillar (CAT) and U.S. Steel (X), both of which enjoyed big market rallies.\\nHospital stocks plummeted amid fears Trump will scale back or even repeal Obamacare, which had provided hospitals with a steady stream of customers. Hospital operators HCA Holdings (HCA) and Tenet Healthcare (THC) plunged 11% and 25%, respectively.\\nSign up for CNNMoney\\'s morning market newsletter: Before The Bell\\nYardeni said Wall Street is anxiously awaiting more clarity on Trump\\'s policy goals, including ones like tax cuts and cutting regulation that could help the economy. He said others like tariffs, trade deals and mass deportation are \"harebrained, and hopefully will be scrapped along the way.\"\\nThe bond markets were also experiencing volatility as Wall Street fretted about how Trump\\'s spending programs could run up the U.S. debt load.\\nThe 10-year Treasury yield, which would normally fall during nervous times in a flight to safety, rose dramatically to a 10-month high of 2.04%. The closely-watched bond rate had been sitting at just 1.85% on Election Day. Longer-term bonds sold off even more, driving the yield of the 30-year up to 2.83%, compared with 2.58% on Election Day.\\nIn another sign of concerns about U.S. debt, Fitch warned on Wednesday that the medium-term impact of Trump\\'s policies \"would be negative\" for U.S. creditworthiness if implemented in full.\\n\"The rhetoric that was talked about on the campaign trail was pretty scary. The nationalism and protectionism,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities.\\n\"But there\\'s a big difference between what you say campaigning and what you do as president,\" Hogan said.',\n",

It\\'s been some campaign,\" Trump said after taking the stage here to a rousing reception. \"They say it\\'s the single greatest movement in the history of this country ... that\\'s quite an honor.\"\\n\"We\\'ll get a tremendous amount of credit if we win or lose,\" he said, adding that his campaign has made the public more aware than ever of the \"rigged system.\" He even said he \"worked very hard\" to get the government to publish data on Obamacare premium hikes, a disclosure he, in fact, did not influence.\\n\\nStill, Trump stressed that he\\'s \"not looking for credit\" should voters deal a death knell to his presidential aspirations.\\nEven as he contemplated the possibility of defeat, Trump expressed hope that his campaign would triumph Tuesday, predicting with characteristic bravado victories in blue states like Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania, where he is hoping white working class voters will turn out in droves.\\n\"You watch what\\'s going to happen in Pennsylvania, the miners are going to come out, the workers are going to come out, the steel workers who lost their jobs are coming out,\" he said.\\nThe Republican nominee also predicted women, too, would turn out in droves to support him Tuesday, despite a candidacy marred by sexual assault allegations and a 2005 tape in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women.\\nTrump also appeared to relish in his final political rallies, raucous spectacles that have defined his campaign from the start. After a week during which he strove to closely stick to the prepared remarks scrolling on the teleprompters before him, Trump veered off script several times as he relived his political victories and his decision more than 500 days ago to run for president.\\nRELATED: In final push, Trump\\'s aggressive campaign swing creeps past midnight\\n\"It was time. It was time. I had to join the other side, which is you,\" Trump said of his switch from insider to establishment-bashing outsider. \"We are going to do things so special.\"\\nAfter spotting a costume mask of his own face in the crowd, Trump had the mask brought up and held it up, side-by-side with his own face before tossing it into the crowd. Minutes later, he spotted a fireman\\'s helmet and held that up on stage as well, touting his support among firemen.\\nTrump also marked his last day of campaigning by serving up some of the vintage, crowd-pleasing riffs that have long been staples of his off-the-cuff campaigning, like his idealistic and humorous vision of a Trump-run country.\\n\"We will start winning again and winning like you\\'ve never seen before. I\\'ll tell you, we\\'re gonna win again. In fact, the people of Florida may get tired of it. You may say, \\'Oh, this guy, he wins too much, we can\\'t take it.

       "\"CNN Article2\\n\\n\\n\\n(CNN)Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are neck-and-neck in a new national tracking poll out Tuesday morning.\\n\\nThe latest ABC News/The Washington Post offering showed Trump barely edging Clinton among likely voters, 46%-45%, well within the poll's 3 percentage point margin of error. Support for Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson, meanwhile has fallen to a new low, according to the poll, plunging to just 3% nationwide. Green Party candidate Jill Stein is at 2%.\\nAlthough Trump's single-point advantage over Clinton is statistically negligible, it is his first lead in an ABC/Post poll since May -- perhaps giving hope to the Republican presidential nominee's supporters, who believe their candidate's prospects were bolstered last week with the revelation that the FBI is reviewing new emails found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, the former congressman and estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.\\nwho's winning?\\ncnn/orc\\tcnn poll of polls\\nHillary Clinton headshot photo\\n49%clinton\\nDonald Trump headshot photo\\n44%trump\\nGary Johnson headshot photo\\n3%johnson\\nJill Stein headshot photo\\n2%stein\\nCNN/ORC poll, October 20-23, 2016, sampling error: +/- 3.5 percentage points, sample: 779 likely voters\\nget more data insights\\nStill, it may be too early to gauge the electoral impact of that development, which broke on Friday. Clinton still leads Trump in the CNN Poll of Polls, an average of the five most recent national phone polls, including Tuesday's ABC/WaPo tracking survey, 46%-42%.\\nThe latest ABC/Post poll showed a lack of enthusiasm among Clinton supporters. Only 45% of the Democratic nominee's backers say they are very enthusiastic about supporting her, down 7 percentage points since the start of the tracking poll and eight points lower than the share of Trump supporters who say they are very enthusiastic about supporting their candidate.\\nThe latest ABC/Post tracking poll was conducted October 27-30 using phone interviews with 1,128 likely voters. It has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.\""

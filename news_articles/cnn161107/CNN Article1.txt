Poll: Clinton leads Trump by 8



Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by 8 percentage points -- doubling her lead from a month ago in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll.

Clinton leads Trump, 50% to 42%, in a head-to-head race, the survey of registered voters found. With Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein added to the race, Clinton maintains her 8-point lead, 45% to Trump's 37%, Johnson's 8% and Stein's 4%.
The poll found huge gaps in voters' take on the two candidates' attributes. Asked whether the candidates have the right personality and temperament to be president, 61% said Clinton does, while 31% said Trump does. Just 33% said Trump understands international matters, while 72% said Clinton does.
Trustworthiness is a problem for both candidates: Only 38% view Clinton as honest and trustworthy, and just 34% say Trump is honest and trustworthy.
The survey shows the damage of Trump's criticism of the Khan family -- the parents of a US soldier killed in combat who blasted Trump at the Democratic National Convention.
Of those surveyed, 73% -- including 59% of Republicans -- said they disapprove of Trump's handling of the situation.
Clinton leads Trump among women, 58% to 35%, and has a 19-point edge among college-educated white women -- a key group both parties target.
The poll found that Clinton is viewed favorably by 48% of registered voters and unfavorably by 50%; Trump is viewed favorably by just 34% and unfavorably by 63%.
Their running mates are popular but much less-known. Clinton's vice presidential nominee, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, is viewed favorably by 41% and unfavorably by 24%; for Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the ratings are 38% favorable, 26% unfavorable.
Clinton has a much more popular spouse, too. Bill Clinton is viewed favorably by 56% of registered voters and unfavorably by 38%; for Melania Trump, it's 33% favorable, 39% unfavorable.

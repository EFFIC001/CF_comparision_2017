Dying Florida man's family fights to get vote counted

From a bed inside his Florida hospice, Thomas Korinko -- whose health is in rapid decline -- was determined to cast his vote in the presidential election.

But 76-year-old Korinko -- who has terminal cancer -- had his mail-in ballot discounted when officials ruled his frail signature did not match that on his voter registration.

Korinko's family told Fox affiliate WOFL that officials with the Lake County Supervisor of Elections Office wouldn't budge when told the man was dying and too weak to cast his vote in person. The family is hoping officials change their mind. 

"This is not voter fraud. He's a registered, lawful, Florida voter," his son, Jeff Korinko, told the station. "This is his ballot, you have it, please count it. I was told, 'No.'"

Thomas was diagnosed with liver cancer seven months ago and has days to live, according to his family. The man opted to vote by mail last week from his hospice in Tavares. 

In Florida, the signature on every mail-in ballot is compared to the voter registration signature on file to prevent fraud. But Jeff Korinko, an attorney, told WOFL, "To be disenfranchised in that manner, that can't be what's in the best interest of the law."

Florida officials reportedly did send Korinko a subsequent affidavit to sign. Korinko, however, was unable to sign the document because of deteriorating health, WOFL reported.

"I'm all cried out ... This was really important to my father," Jeff Korinko told the station.

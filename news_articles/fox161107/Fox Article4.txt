Krauthammer on Trump's role in the GOP if he loses election: 'He will be the power broker'

Syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer said Monday on "Special Report with Bret Baier"  that even if Donald Trump loses the presidential election, he'll still be a force within his party.

"This is a man who, as he says, created a movement out of nothing," Krauthammer said, " He basically fashioned a populist faction in the Republican party, took over the party, at least in this cycle, and then the question will be, is he going to walk away, go back and become a businessman? I doubt it. It's very hard to do. The fact is he will be the power broker."

Krauthammer went on to say he foresees a split within the Republican party between the populist element, which Trump created and mobilized, and the conservative element, led by House Speaker Paul Ryan.

"I say the test will be, can [Trump] bring down Paul Ryan," he asked, adding, "If he's able to get behind a movement to deny Ryan the speakership, he becomes the de facto leader, and the force in the party for the next years while they're in the wilderness."
